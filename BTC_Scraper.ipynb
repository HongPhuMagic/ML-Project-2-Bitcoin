All exchanges have slightly varying prices, no exchanges will have exactly the same price, and often have very difficult and unintuitive APIs to obtain OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) so I chose coinmarketcap. Coinmarketcap averages all different exchanges OHLC and I can easily scrape for this to create a dataset for my algorithms to use. "
