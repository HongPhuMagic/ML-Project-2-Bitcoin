#### Data Source

I've created my own dataset by webscraping coinmarketcap using Selenium and <xpath>. I then created the CSV file which contains all of the list/arrrays I scraped. I chose Selenium over faster methods such as scrapy or beautiful soup due to its capabilities, htlm interaction. I plan on making a trading bot in the future.
